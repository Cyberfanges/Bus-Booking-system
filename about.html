    <h1>THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF TRAVELLING: TRAVELLING IMPROVES YOUR HEALTH AND MIND</h1>
    <b><pre >
  Improving your well-being is one of the fundamental benefits of travelling. Travelling helps to decrease the risks of heart attack and anxiety, while developing our
  brain health. There have been studies proving that travel can place a positive impact on our heart health . The One study from Framingham Heart Studies Organization
  published in the American Journal of Epidemiology shows that women who would travel at least twice year had a significantly lower risk of developing coronary- heart
  disease or heart attack compared with those who would only be able to travel once in every six years.

  One of the health benefits of travelling is that when you travel to new surroundings, you press a restart button to your body and mind, which brings in fresh energy
  when you get back to your regular activities. It keeps you physically fit by being active on the journey, exploring nature, hiking , or strolling the local markets. 
  A healthy body means a healthy mind, and the stimulation you get from travelling can boost your productivity and effectiveness in your daily work.
